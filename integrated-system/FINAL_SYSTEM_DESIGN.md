# SYSTEM OPERATION MODES

## Mode 1: Standard Tracking (Docufile)
```yaml
Process:
  1. Tag individual dockets (always)
  2. Client packs in their boxes
  3. Scan dockets going into box
  4. Box goes to Docufile
  5. System shows: "Docket #123 → Docufile Box #789"
  
Retrieval:
  1. Request from Docufile
  2. 24-48 hour wait
  3. Box returns
  4. Scan to confirm receipt
```

## Mode 2: Managed Storage (Your Service)
```yaml
Process:
  1. Tag individual dockets (always)
  2. Provide tagged storage boxes
  3. System links dockets to boxes
  4. Store in your facility
  5. System shows: "Docket #123 → Storage Room → Box #456 → Shelf B-12"

Retrieval:
  1. Request in system
  2. Handheld guides to exact box
  3. Retrieve in <30 minutes
  4. Automatic checkout logging

Billing:
  - R40/box/month (vs Docufile R50)
  - R100 urgent retrieval fee
  - R500 bulk retrieval service
  - Annual contracts available
```

## Mode 3: Hybrid Approach
```yaml
Active Dockets: On-site with departments
Archive (<2 years): Your managed storage
Deep Archive (>2 years): Docufile

Benefits:
  - Fast access to recent files
  - Lower cost for deep archive
  - Flexibility for clients
```

# SOFTWARE FEATURES

## Core Tracking Features
```typescript
class DocketTracker {
  // Individual docket operations
  async trackDocket(docketId: string) {
    return {
      id: docketId,
      currentLocation: this.getLocation(docketId),
      lastMoved: this.getLastMovement(docketId),
      chainOfCustody: this.getAuditTrail(docketId),
      status: 'Active' | 'Archived' | 'In-Transit'
    };
  }
  
  // Box operations (when used)
  async linkDocketToBox(docketId: string, boxId: string) {
    await this.db.addDocketToBox(docketId, boxId);
    await this.updateLocation(docketId, `Box:${boxId}`);
  }
  
  // Storage service features
  async requestRetrieval(docketId: string, urgent: boolean) {
    const location = await this.findDocket(docketId);
    
    if (location.service === 'ManagedStorage') {
      // Internal retrieval - fast
      return {
        retrievalTime: urgent ? '30 minutes' : '2 hours',
        cost: urgent ? 100 : 0,
        location: location.boxId
      };
    } else {
      // Docufile - slow
      return {
        retrievalTime: '24-48 hours',
        cost: 150,
        reference: this.createDocufileRequest(docketId)
      };
    }
  }
}
```

## Storage Service Module
```typescript
class StorageService {
  // Box management
  async createBox(clientId: string) {
    return {
      boxId: this.generateBoxId(),
      rfidTag: this.assignTag(),
      capacity: 100,
      monthlyRate: 40
    };
  }
  
  // Billing
  async generateInvoice(clientId: string) {
    const boxes = await this.getActiveBoxes(clientId);
    const retrievals = await this.getMonthlyRetrievals(clientId);
    
    return {
      storageCharges: boxes.length * 40,
      retrievalCharges: retrievals.urgent * 100,
      total: (boxes.length * 40) + (retrievals.urgent * 100)
    };
  }
  
  // Competitive advantage
  async compareWithDocufile() {
    return {
      ourService: {
        monthlyRate: 40,
        retrievalTime: '30 minutes',
        tracking: 'Real-time',
        access: '24/7 portal'
      },
      docufile: {
        monthlyRate: 50,
        retrievalTime: '48 hours',
        tracking: 'Manual',
        access: 'Business hours'
      }
